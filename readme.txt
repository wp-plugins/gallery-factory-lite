Great tool for managing large image collections with user-friendly album manager interface and visual layout builder.



== Description ==

Gallery Factory wordpress plugin is the new way to organize your image collection in WordPress. This plugin features the unique Gallery Manager interface, which combines all you need to work with your image galleries in one single place. It is easy to handle even for beginners, yet powerful enough for demanding users. Every piece of the plugin is built to be interactive and self-explaining â€“ from organizing your albums in multi-level folder structure to creating unique layouts in WYSIWYG layout editor.

Gallery Factory stores uploaded images separate from the standard Wordpress location. So you can have huge image collections organized without bloating WP Media and leaving it for other purposes.

Images are organized in folders and albums only on logic level (not touching real folder structure on the disk), so any single image can be added to multiple albums while actually storing only one instance.

But Gallery Factory is not only about uploading and organizing you images: it features unique visual layout editor to help you create incredible galleries. You have two layout types to choose from: responsive grid layout and metro-style layout.

This is the Lite version of the full-featured Gallery Factory plugin, which is available at [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/gallery-factory/11219294).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does Gallery Factory store images? =

GF uses its own folder located at `/wp-content/gf-uploads`

= Does Gallery Factory use custom database tables? =

GF do not create any custom table in the WordPress database. Instead it uses WordPress native tables and custom post types for storing its data. So any tool used for WordPress database import, export and migration should work for GF as well.

= How can I be sure that WordPress has the needed permission to create and write to `/wp-content/gf-uploads` folder? =

GF checks if it can create the `/wp-content/gf-uploads` folder and write to it. If this check fails, you will see the warning notice at the top of the page when you navigate to Gallery Manager.
